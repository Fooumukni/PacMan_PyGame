## Gameplay

![Gameplay](Assets/Media/Gameplay.png)

This is a basic Pacman game. Your goal is to eat all the pellets (Tic - Taks) appeared on the game board without getting caught by the ghosts. There are 4 special pellets (Special Tic-Taks) which grant you a power-up that allows you to have the ability to eat the ghosts and get even more scores in a short amount of time.

The game has a total of 8 levels, you finish a level by eating all the pellets (Tic - Taks) on the game board without using all of your lives (You start the game with 3 lives, but you can get 1 additional life by reaching 10000 score). Everytime you finish a level, you get to the next level, which is the same game board filled again with pellets (Tic - Taks). So as you continue and clear the game board 8 times, you have officially won the game.

The game controls are very simple. You move your Pacman with W, S, A, D keys or arrow keys. You play the game with Space key and quit the game with Enter key.

The game also has a highest score mechanic that saves your highest score and display it in the game. So, good luck and have fun trying out the game ;))
